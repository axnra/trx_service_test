### üß± Example Request Payload

```json
{
  "wallet_address": "TXYZ1234567890"
}
```

## üöÄ Quickstart

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axnra/trx-service-test.git
cd trx-service-test
poetry install
```

### 2. Run app locally (SQLite)

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## üóÉÔ∏è Local development DB setup (SQLite)

To initialize the database for local development using SQLite:

```bash
poetry run python init_db.py
```

This will create a `local.db` file in the project root using the defined models.
Make sure your `.env` has the following entry (or use the default):

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./local.db
```

This avoids the need for Docker or PostgreSQL during development.

## üìú Logs

Application logs are saved to `logs/app.log` with rotation:
- Max file size: **1 MB**
- Retention: **10 days**

Logs are also printed to **stdout** for easier debugging during development.

## üß™ Running tests

Uses SQLite in-memory.

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

> üß† Tests use an in-memory SQLite database for speed and isolation. Production uses PostgreSQL.

All tests live in the `/tests` directory.

---

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** The `DATABASE_URL` is set directly in `docker-compose.yml`. You don't need a `.env` file when using Docker.

## üê≥ Run with Docker

Uses PostgreSQL.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
